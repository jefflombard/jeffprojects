- "Plan first, code second" I didn't want to jump right into coding without having at least a rough idea of what I was planning to build. plan for this so I did some [rough ui designs](designs/projects.sketch).
- Decided to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). No real reason at this point to use anything custom.
